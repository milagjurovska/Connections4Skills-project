## Connections4Skills project hosted by EVN Macedonia

This project hosted by EVN Macedonia for highschool girls looking to go into STEM fields was my first real project I worked on. They provided us with an eight week course on Web Design where we learned the basics of HTML and CSS. 

I worked in a team of three with my classmates.

### This website earned us a third place award in the competiton!
